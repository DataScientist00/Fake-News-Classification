## üéØ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to classify whether a news article is fake or real based on the text content. The system uses two powerful models: 
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: An advanced model for handling sequences, like the text of an article.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: An ensemble method for robust predictions and classification.

The project also includes a **Streamlit web application** where users can input text and receive a fake/real prediction.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DataScientist00/Fake-News-Classification.git
cd Fake-News-Classification
```

### 2. **Install Required Dependencies**
Create a Python virtual environment and install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. **Run the Streamlit App**
Start the Streamlit app to use the fake news classifier:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8501`. You can input text and the model will predict if the article is fake or real.

## üõ† Future Work
- Improve preprocessing techniques like implementing advanced embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) to represent text more effectively.
- Enhance LSTM architecture by exploring variations such as GRU or adding attention mechanisms.
- Further explore ensemble methods or other classification models such as CatBoost.
- Deploy the model for real-time predictions on the web (using Flask or Streamlit) or mobile apps.
